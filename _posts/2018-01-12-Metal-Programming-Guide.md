One of my [goals for 2018](http://alextall.com/2018/01/07/Resolutions-suck.html) is to learn two new programming languages. One language I've been toying with recently has been Apple's Metal. GPU programming has long fascinated me, and since I've been working with XR a lot recently, graphics programming felt like a logical step.

To this end, I picked up a copy of [Metal Programming Guide](https://www.informit.com/store/metal-programming-guide-tutorial-and-reference-via-9780134668994) by the wonderful [Janie Clayton](https://twitter.com/redqueencoder). I've already read the first 4 chapters, so I'll start this weekend with Chapter 5, Getting Started with Shaders.
