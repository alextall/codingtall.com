I have sorely neglected my creative side for far too long. One goal of mine for 2018 is to fix that.

## A little about me

I started playing with 3d modeling and animation in the early 2000s with Lightwave. (I think it was version ~7ish at that time.) Over the years I explored Blender, Modo, 3dsmax (back in the Discreet days), and Maya. Eventually I decided to pursue technology as a career and began spending my free time working on my CompSci skills and ignoring art. I made a couple weak attempts to return to my artistic roots, but that never went anywhere.

## Getting started

That brings us to today. Or rather a couple weeks ago. I decided I wanted to push the imaginative side of me more, so I hit up [Lynda.com](http://lynda.com) and found a great [intro to Maya LT](https://www.lynda.com/Maya-tutorials/Up-Running-Maya-LT/408407-2.html) to get reintroduced with things. The course was a great refresher on the basics of the Maya interface, modeling, materials, animating, and keeping all of your stuff organized.

I just finished the videos about an hour ago, but I'm already looking around for tiny projects to get started on. My first project was obvious, though. I always start off by making a mushroom like those from the Mario game series. This one is based on the mushrooms from [Mario Kart 8](https://www.mariowiki.com/File:MushroomMarioKart8.png).

## Why 2018 will be different

I am determined to keep this going, so I have set a specific list of courses to follow, and when those are done I'm tasking myself with making all of the assets necessary for any XR projects going forward.
